              <h3>Experienced in my Craft</h3>
              <p>Having worked as a plasterer in Leicester for over 10 years I have worked on various residential and commercial properties where no 2 jobs are the same, I  have developed skills to cope and
                 provide solutions to the unexpected. This experience vital in providing a final finished product with no loose ends. 
                 <br><br>
                Experience such as turning up to jobs, noticing a slight dampness in the existing plaster and brick work which could easily be overlooked. Picking up on this I am able to advise on the correct
                course of action ensuring that when the room is plastered it survives the test of time.</p>

                  Conscious that I do work in peoples homes and plastering has a reputation for being a messy trade, but don't let this put you off just look at some of my reviews on

              <h3>Pride in my Work</h3>
              <p>I take pride in my work and the plastering services that I provide to my customers in Blaby and the wider Leicester area. Once I have finished the job and handed the work over to the customer I want them to be happy
                with what they have paid for, my rates are competitive and this is more than reflected in my quality of work.
                <br> <br>
                I will always encourage my clients to pick up the phone and get in touch if they have any queries about my plastering work once it has been completed. Just because the work has been finished and the customer has paid, I still hold
                myself to a standard where I want to provide the customer with the best service possible.
